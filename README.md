# Assignment 1: Why?

Initially, enrolling in Computer Science was one of the last things on my list, if someone asked the elementary to highschool me about their aspirations, it would be to become a doctor. I was really into the Science field, mainly Astronomy, Biology and little bit of Chemistry.

Technically, HTML was the first programming language that I ever encounter, which was during 8th Grade. I HATED it with every fiber of my being, I didn't like the thought of wasting so much time just to make pixels on a screen look beautiful together. I thought that was what programming was about and I was not interested whatsoever. But, we can say that I found my "first love" when I was in 9th Grade, around 12 years old. 

That was the first time that I encountered an actual "Programming Languages" (not markup language). And I can say that at that moment, I genuinely fell in Love with it. Something about the frustration of debugging and typing only to feel that sense of euphoria the moment it actually works just allured me further into it. Initially, during my first year, I learned the basics of text printing and variable types, but the time that I really enjoyed it more was 10th Grade when I first encountered Arduino. Typing letters and numbers in a computer to make something in real life move or function just added to the list of reasons why I loved Programming.

After Junior Highschool, I chose to genuinely pursue that path. I had to leave the school where I graduated JHS from since they only offered STEM, and I was thinking that I really have to specialize and thus, needed to find a school offering an ICT track. And that was where I enrolled to. Senior High was also the time that I was first intrigued with Game Development. Minecraft, a childhood game of mine, gave me the idea to learn Java Programming more. The more I learned Java, the more I realized just how amazing programming can really be, and how it worked fundamentally. It made me see the world in a whole different view, one where systems and programs no longer looked like a black box.

Now, as I was learning more about the fundamentals of programming, it also coincidentally was the time when Generative AI Models such as ChatGPT gained popularity. That was the moment when I realized just how much the world may change in a couple of years. This new technology, able to mimic a fraction of human intelligence, really fascinated me. A system that has it's own autonomy and way of working without explicit instructions. This made me think that Artificial Intelligence will be that next milestone that changes the world drastically, the way the invention and slow integration of the internet did to to our culture and way of living. It brought me the urgency to learn this new field and maybe, even take part in it's development. 

This is a large reason of **WHY** I chose to be in Computer Science. I saw myself in the perfect situation, as the technology was developed enough that the very fundamentals and core elements have already been discovered, yet new enough that these core elements are still being experimented on. Being in this course will (hopefully) give me the tools and foundation to be able to genuinely explore this familiar yet uncharted field. A field in which I believe that even small steps can bring major breakthroughs to our life.

With this, it amazes me just how much potential Artificial Intelligence has, where all of those Science Fiction stories are starting to sound more and more realistic by the moment. Being able to (hopefully) be a part of such a fascinating field brings me great joy and pride, not just for myself but for the entire human race as a whole. Sooner or later, life will no longer be the same as today hopefully for the better, and I will be glad to be able to take part in that transformation.
