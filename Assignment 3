# Assignment 3: Commentary on Loops

Loops has been a big part of my, and I assume, any programming career. The very first loop that I have used, which if I remember correctly was the For loop, all the way back on the my 9th grade, where we are taught to make the "Hello World" of loops, which was the Asterisk Pyramid. But, like many, loops are often preferrential and the use of it depends on the programmer, and so, we shall make a "Loop Tierlist" which is entirely based on my own opinion.

First of, to get the guide questions out of the way, I'd like to tackle about labels and "goto" in C. To be completely honest, I have never encountered labels or goto before reasing the lesson. It has never been taught to me nor have I seen it used anywhere. Based on my understanding, labels are like a "Checkpoint" where in the program can go back to at any time using the goto when in a function. 

The way I see it is that it is really only useful when being used to reuse a part of the function without having to type it out again, or as mentioned in the module, used to immediately exit nested loops and to get to a "fail safe" function. Other than those uses, it just makes the code a bit harder to follow, as it just loops back to itself. A clean loop or function call would be a lot better than using labels and goto. Certainly an F tier.

Second is my own favorite, the While loop, which is a great simple and clean loop that can do what is needed without being hard to understand. It uses exactly just what the user needs to use, without any other exessive variables or declaration.
