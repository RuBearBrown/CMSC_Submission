# Assignment 3: Commentary on Loops

Loops has been a big part of my, and I assume, any programming career. The very first loop that I have used, which if I remember correctly was the For loop, all the way back on the my 9th grade, where we are taught to make the "Hello World" of loops, which was the Asterisk Pyramid. But, like many, loops are often preferrential and the use of it depends on the programmer, and so, we shall make a "Loop Tierlist" which is entirely based on my own opinion.

First of, to get the guide questions out of the way, I'd like to tackle about labels and "goto" in C. To be completely honest, I have never encountered labels or goto before reasing the lesson. It has never been taught to me nor have I seen it used anywhere. Based on my understanding, labels are like a "Checkpoint" where in the program can go back to at any time using the goto when in a function. Based on some reading, this was actually how loops worked under the hood, and what was initially used on previous lower level programming languages, where loops didn't use to exist.

The way I see it is that it is really only useful when being used to reuse a part of the function without having to type it out again, or as mentioned in the module, used to immediately exit nested loops and to get to a "fail safe" function. Other than those uses, it just makes the code a bit harder to follow, as it just loops back to itself. A clean loop or function call would be a lot better than using labels and goto. Certainly an F tier.

Second is my own favorite, the While loop, which is a great simple and clean loop that can be used to handle more complex operations where the amount of loops is not entirely defined. It is structured in a way that allows the user to more freely manipulate the variables and set up their own ways to end the loop. Unlike the For loop, it is generally used more to work with more situational conditionals like state changes or other non-integer based changes. Definitely an easy S tier.

The Third is the For loop, the fast food of loops that is used to make quick iterations of a certain part of the code without having to type much. It is best to be used when looping for a certain amound of time, or iterating inside array values. I usually use this mostly in accessing and manipulating values of arrays or dictionaries as they are a clean way to store multiple amounts of related data. As to why it is Structured that way, I am unsure if the question is about the historical background of why it became what it is, or my own opinion of why I think it is the way it is.

But, I will answer both regardless, and I will answer the latter first: like I mentioned, the For loop is very simple to use as it's syntax already contains everything that is needed to make a clearly defined amount of iterations. The first part of the syntax contains the initialization of values that will change overtime, the second is the condition that terminates the loop and the third is where the variables gets updated.

As for why it looks the way it is, I have read (or more honestly, asked GPT why) that it is because of it's predecessors, the ALGOL58 or ALGOL60 and FORTRAN which uses a similar syntax on their loops. Regardless, I place it just below the While loop, an A tier.

Lastly, the do while loop, the middle child of all the loops, often forgotten. This is a rarely situational loop that even I have rarely really used. I personally rarely uses it too. But it is a good loop especially for things that requires initialization or an input before having to check the input in particular, it is great for case sensitive answers or those than can only have specific values. It is also good for ensuring some parts of the code happens before having to redo it. 

But generally, while loops are still used above do while loops since most loops are used to alter values and data, if do while is used, data might be changed even if the condition was supposed to prevent it from happening. I can probably put it in the B tier.
